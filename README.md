## Mangaplus View Count Tracker

### Overview
Noticed there wasn't any solid data for mangaplus view counts when I was looking for who gained the most views like last month, so I decided to do it myself.
Started by trying to scrape data from the platform's official rankings, but it was all over the place and not updated regularly. So, I am tracking it myself more accurately(hopefully).

### How It Works
scraping data from the daily updates page (https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/updates) everyday at 11:59pm jst, this g4rabs the most recent 50-ish new releases,
saving it then displaying it using plotly


### Future Plans
- Get it stable enough I forget this exists
- Maybe work on cool statistics

FYI This is for the website views, the mobile app views are separate
